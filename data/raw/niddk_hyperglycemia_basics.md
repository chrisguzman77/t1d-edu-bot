## Summary
Hyperglycemia means blood glucose levels that are higher than target range. Common causes
include missed insulin doses, infection, stress, or eating more carbohydrates than planned.
Mild highs may cause thirst or fatigue; prolonged or extreme highs can cause dehydration and
increase DKA risk. Educational steps include reviewing insulin timing, staying hydrated, and
checking ketones if BG exceeds 250 mg/dL.

Consistent hyperglycemia can signal the need to adjust therapy with a clinician. Education
focuses on recognition, prevention, and maintaining a consistent routine with monitoring.

## Key Points
- Defined as BG persistently above target (often > 180 mg/dL).
- Check ketones if BG > 250 mg/dL, especially when sick.
- Address missed insulin or dietary causes.
- Long-term highs raise DKA risk.

## Terms to Know
- **Hyperglycemia:** Elevated blood glucose beyond individualized target range.
- **Target Range:** BG levels recommended by the care team, often 70â€“180 mg/dL for adults.
