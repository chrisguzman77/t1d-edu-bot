## Summary
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems measure interstitial glucose every few minutes
using a small sensor under the skin. CGMs help people with type 1 diabetes observe trends,
reduce hypoglycemia, and improve time-in-range. Alerts warn users of rising or falling
glucose levels. Education focuses on interpreting trend arrows, responding to alerts, and
confirming with fingersticks when appropriate.

Most CGM systems display readings on a smartphone or receiver and sync data to the cloud for
review with clinicians.

## Key Points
- CGMs track glucose trends 24 / 7 and provide alerts.
- Trend arrows help predict where BG is heading.
- Always confirm with a meter when symptoms don’t match readings.
- Replace sensors per manufacturer guidance.

## Terms to Know
- **CGM:** Continuous Glucose Monitor.
- **Time-in-Range:** Percentage of readings within target range (often 70–180 mg/dL).
