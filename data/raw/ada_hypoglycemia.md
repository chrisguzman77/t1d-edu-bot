## Summary
Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose (BG) drops below about 70 mg/dL. Common early signs
include shakiness, sweating, fast heartbeat, hunger, and irritability. Some people may not
feel symptoms (hypoglycemia unawareness). Education typically emphasizes checking BG,
consuming rapid-acting carbs, and rechecking.

For treatment, many education guides describe the “15–15 rule” (example framing only):
consume ~15 grams of fast carbs (like glucose tablets or juice), then recheck BG in about
15 minutes and repeat if still low. Severe hypoglycemia can cause confusion, seizure, or
unconsciousness—this is a medical emergency and may require glucagon.

## Key Points
- "Low" is typically BG < 70 mg/dl (varies per care plan)
- Fast carbs first; avoid high-fat foods for inital treatment.
- Recheck BG after treating; repeat if needed.
- Severe lows are emergencies.

## Terms to know
- Glucagon: A horomone/medication used to raise BG during severe hypogycemia.
- Hypoglycemia unawareness: Reduced ability to sense low BG symptoms.
