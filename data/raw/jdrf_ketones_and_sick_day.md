## Summary
During illness, the body releases stress hormones that raise blood glucose (BG) and increase
the risk of ketone buildup. Ketones form when the body burns fat instead of glucose. For
people with type 1 diabetes, this can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious
emergency. Sick-day management includes more frequent BG and ketone checks, maintaining
hydration, and adjusting insulin per medical guidance.

If BG stays high (>250 mg/dL) and ketones are moderate or large, medical evaluation is
urgent. Educational resources emphasize early testing and prevention rather than waiting
for symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

## Key Points
- Always check for ketones when BG > 250 mg/dl for during illness.
- Hydration helps clear ketones.
- Never stop basal insulin even when not eating (unless directed by your clinician).
- Seek medical care if vomiting, unable to eat, or ketones are moderate / large.

## Terms to Know
- **Ketones:** By-products of fat metabolism; high levels indicate the body lacks usable insulin.
- **DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis):** Dangerous acid buildup due to insulin deficiency.
