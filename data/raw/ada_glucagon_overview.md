## Summary
Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose. Injectable or nasal glucagon is used to
treat severe hypoglycemia when the person cannot safely swallow. Education covers when and
how to use glucagon, storage, and caregiver training. Newer formulations (nasal spray or
auto-injector) simplify emergency use.

Care partners should know where glucagon is stored and how to use it. After treatment, call
emergency services and follow up with a clinician to identify possible causes of the severe
low.

## Key Points
- Glucagon treats severe hypoglycemia (unconsciousness, seizure, or inability to eat).
- Train family / friends on use.
- Keep glucagon accessible and check expiration date.
- Call emergency services after use.

## Terms to Know
- **Glucagon:** Hormone that releases stored glucose from the liver to raise BG.
- **Severe Hypoglycemia:** Low BG requiring help from another person.
