## Summary
Physical activity benefits cardiovascular health and insulin sensitivity. For people with
type 1 diabetes, exercise can cause BG to drop during or after activity, so planning and
monitoring are essential. Typical strategies include checking BG before, during, and after
exercise, and consuming carbohydrates if needed. Education emphasizes gradual progression,
hydration, and safety.

Different activities affect BG differently: aerobic (running, cycling) often lowers it,
while high-intensity or anaerobic activity may cause temporary rises. Post-exercise BG
monitoring helps prevent delayed lows.

## Key Points
- Check BG before, during, and after exercise.
- Have fast carbs available in case of lows.
- Avoid starting exercise if BG > 250 mg/dL with ketones.
- Individualize plans with your care team.

## Terms to Know
- **Aerobic Exercise:** Activity that increases heart rate steadily (e.g., jogging).
- **Anaerobic Exercise:** Intense bursts using stored energy (e.g., sprinting).
